## Commit messages

Commits follow Conventional Commits and standard git formatting. The gitlint
configuration is in `.gitlint`; CI checks the current commit message. The
rootless workflow also checks Rust formatting, Clippy, tests and doctests on
amd64 and Arm64.

- Subject: `type(scope): summary` — lowercase, imperative, no trailing period,
  at most 50 characters. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`,
  `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`, `spec`.
- One blank line, then a body wrapped at 72 characters explaining what changed
  and why (not how — the diff shows how).
- Write each message to stand on its own: describe the change and its rationale
  for a reader with no knowledge of the project's history or how the work was
  produced. Do not reference internal process, prior iterations, or review
  back-and-forth. (gitlint cannot check this — it is a review responsibility.)
