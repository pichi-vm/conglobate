# Distro qualification inputs

`prepare.py` copies an existing local artifact manifest and its components into
a new OCI image-layout directory, verifies their SHA-256 digests and sizes, and
creates a pinned architecture index for conglobate's lock file. It never downloads
artifacts. Run it without privileges:

```sh
python3 tests/distro/prepare.py \
  --source-cache /path/to/cache \
  --manifest sha256:MANIFEST_DIGEST \
  --architecture amd64 \
  --output /path/to/new/cache
```

The output must not exist. Successful output is made read-only and `index.pin`
contains the index digest. Failed attempts remain available for inspection.
The supplied architecture describes the existing artifact; this script does not
inspect executable machine types or convert architectures.

This is fixture preparation, not distro qualification. Conglobate must still
verify the carapace chain, execute a real distro recipe, and produce an image
that boots. The Fedora preparation recorded in
`preservation/m7-review/fedora-input-preparation.json` has only passed component
integrity and output nonreplacement checks. See `M7-QUALIFICATION.md` for the
remaining build, boot, SELinux and platform requirements.
